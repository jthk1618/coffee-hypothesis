# Coffee Hypothesis

Some analysis into my personal health and subjective wellbeing data

### Coffee Hypothesis

I recorded the time of every coffee I consumed for a year to see how it impacts
my sleep. This analysis with some other hints from my DNA, coffee preferences,
etc have set up the preamble for a fresh experiment. More to come!

### Oura Analysis

Data from my Oura ring allows me to make some connections with exercise and
sleep. Also the coffee stuff above. For the most part, the data shows
quantitatively patterns I would expect to see in a typical week. As an example,
autocorrelation with a lag of 3 days regarding exercise matches my expectations.

This suggests to me that I can build some kind of data based habit nudging
system system.
