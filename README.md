# Coffee Hypothesis

Some analysis into my personal health and subjective wellbeing data

### HRV - ARIMA

Of the variables looked at from the Oura analysis, a few of them including HRV
shows some timeseries niceness. I think I can try out some ARIMA (and the
seasonal version) time analysis.

### ðŸš§Coffee Hypothesis

I recorded the time of every coffee I consumed for a year to see how it impacts
my sleep. This analysis with some other hints from my DNA, coffee preferences,
etc have set up the preamble for a fresh experiment. More to come!

### ðŸš§Sleeptime Hypothesis
Earlier bedtime sanity check

### Oura Analysis

The Oura analysis is a sandbox for exploration and hypothesis formulating.
Data from my Oura ring allows me to make some connections with exercise and
sleep. Also the coffee stuff above. For the most part, the data shows
quantitatively patterns I would expect to see in a typical week. As an example,
autocorrelation with a lag of 3 days regarding exercise matches my expectations.

This suggests to me that I can build some kind of data based habit nudging
system system.
