    "[Heart Rate Variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability) is the primary meaure of preparedness for stress which My Oura ring uses to advise me on how much exercise would be ideal for me for that day. It lines up quite well with my subjective feeling, but an intra-day comparison shows that there's zero correlation. Of course, I really ought to consider the few days of data before. I'll get around to that.\n",

    "### Intro – ARIMA GARCH <a id=\"arima-garch\">\n",
    "In any case, I thought i'd try throwing [ARIMA](https://python-bloggers.com/2021/04/arima-model-in-python/) and GARCH at my own health data and seeing what would come of it. The ARIMA model can be checked against future data to see if it can make predictions on future data. On the GARCH side of things, I can turn it into a product. Something that makes predictions dynamically. Originally, ARCH/GARCH is a model designed for making econometric predictions by taking into consideration autocorrelative implications for hetroskedasticity - in english, (G)ARCH is a prediction model that is backwards-looking (in time, when applied to timeseries) and takes into consideration the volatility of previous data.\n",

    "> I'm still out past my bed time? It automatically guesses how much sleep I need and based on that expectation, adjusts my Hue light auto-on feature and my alarm to match it appropriately. Of course, I can sign off on the suggestion once I'm in bed or make changes.\n",
