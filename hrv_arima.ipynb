    "[Heart Rate Variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability) is the primary meaure of preparedness for stress which My Oura ring uses to advise me on how much exercise would be ideal for me for that day. It lines up quite well with my subjective feeling, but an intra-day comparison shows that there's zero correlation. Of course, I really ought to consider the few days of data before. I'll get around to that.\n",

    "In any case, I thought i'd try throwing ARIMA and GARCH at my own health data and seeing what would come of it. The ARIMA model can be checked against future data to see if it can make predictions on future data. On the GARCH side of things, I can turn it into a product. Something that makes predictions dynamically.\n",
